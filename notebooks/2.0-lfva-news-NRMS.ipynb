    "News recommendation can help users find in- terested news and alleviate information over- load. Precisely modeling news and users is critical for news recommendation, and capturing the contexts of words and news is important to learn news and user representations. The paper, proposea a neural news recommendation approach with multi-head self- attention (NRMS). The core of the approach is a news encoder and a user encoder. In the news encoder, it is used multi-head self-attentions to learn news representations from news titles by modeling the interactions between words. In the user encoder, it is learned the representations of users from their browsed news and use multihead self-attention to capture the relatedness between the news. Besides, it is appled additive attention to learn more informative news and user representations by selecting important words and news.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approch is motivated by several observations. First, the interactions between words in news title are important for understanding the news. For example, in Fig. 1, the word “Rockets” has strong relatedness with “Bulls”. Besides, a word may in- teract with multiple words, e.g., “Rockets” also has semantic interactions with “trade”. Second, different news articles browsed by the same user may also have relatedness. For example, in Fig. 1 the second news is related to the first and the third news. Third, different words may have different importance in representing news. In Fig. 1, the word “NBA” is more informative than “2018”. Besides, different news articles browsed by the same user may also have different importance in representing this user. For example, the first three news articles are more informative than the last one."
